Many businesses and individuals struggle to understand the complex dynamics of social media influence. 
Identifying key influencers and understanding how information and trends spread within the Instagram network is challenging.

This project aims to develop a database-driven system for analyzing social media networks to identify key influencers and understand their impact.
By leveraging a graph database and integrating with social media APIs, the system will map complex relationships between users, their content, and their interactions.
With the output of this analysis, we can automate the scouting process that social media agencies go through in order to hire influencers
